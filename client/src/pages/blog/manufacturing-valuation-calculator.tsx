      question: "How accurate is a manufacturing business valuation calculator?",
      answer: "Our manufacturing business calculator uses industry-standard SDE methodology and provides estimates typically within 10-15% of professional appraisals. However, for final valuations (especially for sales over $1M), we recommend our $39 professional report or certified appraisal."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes manufacturing valuations different from service businesses?",
      answer: "Manufacturing businesses require additional analysis of equipment, inventory, real estate, and production capacity. Our calculator incorporates equipment depreciation, inventory turnover, and manufacturing-specific multiples ranging from 2.0x-6.5x SDE depending on sector."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to include equipment value separately?",
      answer: "No, our SDE-based methodology captures equipment value through cash flow analysis. However, for asset-heavy manufacturing businesses, we also provide equipment valuation analysis to ensure comprehensive results."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does a professional manufacturing business appraisal cost?",
      answer: "Traditional manufacturing appraisals cost $15,000-$50,000 and take 4-8 weeks. Our calculator provides instant estimates for free, with detailed $39 professional reports available immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "What manufacturing types work best with SDE valuation?",
      answer: "SDE methodology works excellently for manufacturing businesses under $5M revenue including food processing, electronics assembly, custom manufacturing, textile production, and light industrial. Heavy manufacturing may require additional asset-based analysis."

                    <p>Automotive manufacturing businesses benefit from long-term contracts but face cyclical demand and quality requirements. Tier 1 suppliers command higher multiples due to established relationships.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Aerospace Manufacturing</h4>
                    <p><strong>Typical SDE Multiple:</strong> 4.0x - 6.0x</p>
                    <p>Aerospace manufacturing typically commands premium multiples due to high barriers to entry, certifications required, and long product lifecycles. Defense contracts provide additional stability.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Medical Device Manufacturing</h4>

                <p>Several key factors significantly impact your manufacturing business valuation:</p>
                
                <div className="factor">
                  <h3>🎯 Market Position & Competition</h3>
                  <p>Companies with strong market positions, unique products, or competitive advantages command higher multiples. Consider your market share, brand recognition, and barriers to entry.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="factor">
                  <h3>👥 Customer Base Diversity</h3>
                  <p>Businesses with diversified customer bases are valued higher than those dependent on few large customers. Aim for less than 30% revenue from your top 3 customers.</p>
                </div>

                  <h3>⚡ Operational Efficiency</h3>
                  <p>Efficient operations with high capacity utilization, low waste, and optimized processes increase value. Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma implementations are positively viewed.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="factor">
                  <h3>📈 Growth Potential</h3>
                  <p>Businesses with clear growth opportunities, expansion potential, or new product pipelines receive higher multiples. Unused capacity can be particularly valuable.</p>

                <p>Avoid these common pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate valuations:</p>
                
                <div className="mistake">
                  <h3>❌ Mistake #1: Ignoring Equipment Depreciation</h3>
                  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Using book value instead of fair market value for equipment.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Get current market appraisals for major equipment pieces. Our calculator considers actual equipment values, not accounting depreciation.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="mistake">
                  <h3>❌ Mistake #2: Overlooking Inventory Obsolescence</h3>
                  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Including slow-moving or obsolete inventory at full cost.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Analyze inventory turnover and adjust for obsolete stock. Focus on products that actually sell.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="mistake">
                  <h3>❌ Mistake #3: Wrong Industry Multiple</h3>
                  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Using generic manufacturing multiples instead of sector-specific ones.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Use industry-specific multiples. Electronics manufacturing (3.5x-6.0x) is very different from chemical manufacturing (2.0x-4.0x).</p>

                  <h3>❌ Mistake #4: Ignoring Environmental Liabilities</h3>
                  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Not accounting for potential environmental cleanup costs.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Factor in environmental assessments and potential liabilities, especially for chemical or heavy manufacturing businesses.</p>

                <div className="mistake">
                  <h3>❌ Mistake #5: Overvaluing Customer Contracts</h3>
                  <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Assuming all customer relationships will transfer to a new owner.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Consider contract terms, customer loyalty, and the likelihood of contract renewal under new ownership.</p>

                <div className="faq-item">
                  <h3>Q: How accurate is a manufacturing business valuation calculator?</h3>
                  <p>A: Our manufacturing business calculator uses industry-standard SDE methodology and provides estimates typically within 10-15% of professional appraisals. However, for final valuations (especially for sales over $1M), we recommend our $39 professional report or certified appraisal.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="faq-item">
                  <h3>Q: What makes manufacturing valuations different from service businesses?</h3>
                  <p>A: Manufacturing businesses require additional analysis of equipment, inventory, real estate, and production capacity. Our calculator incorporates equipment depreciation, inventory turnover, and manufacturing-specific multiples ranging from 2.0x-6.5x SDE depending on sector.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="faq-item">
                  <h3>Q: Do I need to include equipment value separately?</h3>
                  <p>A: No, our SDE-based methodology captures equipment value through cash flow analysis. However, for asset-heavy manufacturing businesses, we also provide equipment valuation analysis to ensure comprehensive results.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="faq-item">
                  <h3>Q: How much does a professional manufacturing business appraisal cost?</h3>
                  <p>A: Traditional manufacturing appraisals cost $15,000-$50,000 and take 4-8 weeks. Our calculator provides instant estimates for free, with detailed $39 professional reports available immediately.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="faq-item">
                  <h3>Q: What manufacturing types work best with SDE valuation?</h3>
                  <p>A: SDE methodology works excellently for manufacturing businesses under $5M revenue including food processing, electronics assembly, custom manufacturing, textile production, and light industrial. Heavy manufacturing may require additional asset-based analysis.</p>
