                    <p>Bella's Italian Bistro was valued at <strong>$630,000</strong> using our SDE methodology. The owner initially thought their restaurant was worth only $400,000 based on revenue multiples. Our calculator revealed an additional <strong>$230,000 in value</strong> by properly accounting for owner benefits and using industry-appropriate multiples.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How accurate is your restaurant valuation calculator?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Our calculator uses the same SDE methodology trusted by business brokers and lenders nationwide. While no online calculator can replace a professional appraisal, our results are typically within 10-15% of professional valuations, making it an excellent starting point for planning and negotiations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: What's the difference between SDE and EBITDA for restaurant valuation?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> SDE (Seller's Discretionary Earnings) is preferred for restaurants under $5M in revenue because it adds back owner benefits, making it more accurate for small business valuations. EBITDA is typically used for larger corporations and doesn't account for owner compensation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How often should I get my restaurant valued?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> We recommend getting a valuation annually or whenever you're considering major decisions like selling, refinancing, or bringing in partners. Market conditions and your restaurant's performance can change significantly over time.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Can I use this calculator for franchise restaurants?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, but franchise restaurants have additional considerations like royalty fees, territory rights, and brand value. Our calculator provides a base valuation, but franchise-specific factors may require additional analysis.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: What if my restaurant is losing money?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Our calculator can still provide insights, but unprofitable restaurants are typically valued based on asset value rather than earnings. We'll help you understand your options and potential turnaround strategies.</p>
