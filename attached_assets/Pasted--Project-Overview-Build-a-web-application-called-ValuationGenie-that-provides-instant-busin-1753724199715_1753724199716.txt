**Additional Requirements: Intelligent Questionnaire & User Clarity**

1. **Intelligent Questionnaire Design**
   - Before building the questionnaire, research the most important factors and questions that affect small business valuation for both buyers and sellers.
     - Consider industry standards, best practices, and what professional business appraisers ask.
     - Include questions that capture not just financials, but also qualitative factors (e.g., owner involvement, customer concentration, growth trends, risks, competitive advantages).
     - Tailor some questions based on whether the user is a buyer or a seller (e.g., “What is your main goal: maximize sale price, quick sale, etc.?” for sellers; “What is your main concern: risk, growth, etc.?” for buyers).
   - The app should explain to users, in plain language, why each question is being asked and how it affects the valuation.
     - For example:
       - “We ask about owner involvement because businesses that run independently of the owner are often valued higher.”
       - “Growth trends can increase or decrease your business’s value—please describe any recent changes.”
   - The questionnaire should be dynamic:
     - If possible, adjust follow-up questions based on previous answers (e.g., if the business is in a specific industry, ask industry-relevant questions).

2. **User Clarity and Transparency**
   - At the start of the questionnaire, display a clear message:
     - “To provide the most accurate valuation, we’ll ask you a series of questions about your business. Each question is designed to capture factors that affect your business’s value, whether you’re buying or selling. We’ll explain why we ask each question along the way.”
   - For each question, include a short explanation or tooltip:
     - “Why we ask this: [brief explanation].”
   - After the questionnaire, show a summary:
     - “Here’s how your answers impact your valuation: [list key factors and their influence].”

3. **Research and Best Practices**
   - Before finalizing the questionnaire, research reputable sources (e.g., IBBA, BizBuySell, business broker guides) to ensure the questions align with industry best practices.
   - Optionally, provide references or links to users who want to learn more.
