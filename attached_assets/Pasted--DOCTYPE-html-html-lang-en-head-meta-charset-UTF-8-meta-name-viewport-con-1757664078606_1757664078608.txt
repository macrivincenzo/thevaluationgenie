            <h2>Common Service Business Valuation Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
            <p>These mistakes can cost you thousands in undervalued sales:</p>
            
            <div class="mistakes-list">
                <div class="mistake">
                    <h3>❌ Using Revenue Instead of SDE</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Valuing based on gross revenue without considering profitability and owner benefits.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always use SDE (Seller's Discretionary Earnings) which accounts for owner benefits and provides a true picture of cash flow available to a new owner.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mistake">
                    <h3>❌ Ignoring Client Concentration Risk</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Not accounting for the risk of losing major clients or revenue concentration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Apply risk discounts for high client concentration and work to diversify your client base to increase business value.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mistake">
                    <h3>❌ Overlooking Key Person Dependency</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Not considering how dependent the business is on the owner or key employees.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Document processes, cross-train employees, and reduce key person dependency to increase transferability and value.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mistake">
                    <h3>❌ Not Valuing Client Relationships</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Treating all revenue equally without considering contract stability and client relationships.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Document client contracts, retention rates, and relationship strength to demonstrate revenue quality and stability.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="mistake">
                    <h3>❌ Ignoring Scalability Factors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Not considering the business's ability to grow without proportional cost increases.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Highlight systems, processes, and technology that enable efficient scaling to justify higher multiples.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Service Business Valuation</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How accurate is your service business valuation calculator?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Our calculator uses the same SDE methodology trusted by business brokers and lenders nationwide. While no online calculator can replace a professional appraisal, our results are typically within 10-15% of professional valuations, making it an excellent starting point for planning and negotiations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How do you account for client relationships in service business valuation?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> We analyze client retention rates, contract lengths, recurring revenue percentages, and concentration risk. Strong client relationships with high retention (85%+) and recurring revenue can increase valuations by 20-40% compared to project-based businesses.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: What's the difference between SDE and EBITDA for service business valuation?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> SDE (Seller's Discretionary Earnings) is preferred for service businesses under $5M in revenue because it adds back owner benefits, making it more accurate for small business valuations. EBITDA is typically used for larger corporations and doesn't account for owner compensation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How does recurring revenue affect service business value?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Recurring revenue significantly increases service business value. Businesses with 60%+ recurring revenue often command 1.5x-2x higher multiples than project-based services due to predictable cash flows and reduced sales costs.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How often should I get my service business valued?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> We recommend getting a valuation annually or whenever you're considering major decisions like selling, seeking investment, or bringing in partners. Service markets evolve rapidly, and your business value can change significantly over time.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Can I use this calculator for professional service firms?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, our calculator works excellently for professional services including consulting, accounting, legal, marketing, and other knowledge-based businesses. Professional services often command higher multiples due to specialized expertise and client relationships.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How does key person dependency affect service business valuation?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> High key person dependency can reduce valuations by 20-50%. Businesses heavily dependent on the owner or key employees are riskier for buyers. Documenting processes and reducing key person dependency increases transferability and value.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: What's a good gross margin for service businesses?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Gross margins vary by service type, but generally 40-80% is considered healthy for service businesses. Higher margins typically command higher valuation multiples, while margins below 30% may indicate pricing pressure or operational inefficiencies.</p>
