Hi Replit! I need you to help me optimize my website https://thevaluationgenie.com/ to get 100 on all PageSpeed Insights metrics.

My current scores are:
- Performance: 56 (needs improvement)
- Accessibility: 96 (good)
- Best Practices: 96 (good)
- SEO: 100 (perfect)

I want you to implement ALL the optimizations needed to get 100 on everything. Here's what you need to do step by step:

## STEP 1: Analyze My Current Code
First, please look at my current HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to understand what needs optimization.

## STEP 2: Fix Performance Issues (Target: 100)
- Eliminate render-blocking resources (CSS and JavaScript)
- Implement critical CSS inline for above-the-fold content
- Add preload for critical resources
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Optimize cache policies with .htaccess
- Fix large layout shifts (CLS)
- Reduce unused JavaScript (currently 1,020 Kibit)
- Reduce unused CSS (currently 95 Kibit)
- Modernize JavaScript for modern browsers

## STEP 3: Fix Core Web Vitals
- Improve First Contentful Paint (FCP) from 8.8s to under 1.8s
- Improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) from 13.9s to under 2.5s
- Optimize Total Blocking Time (TBT) from 60ms to under 200ms
- Implement image optimization (WebP, responsive images)
- Add resource preloading and DNS prefetching

## STEP 4: Fix Accessibility Issues (Target: 100)
- Fix contrast issues between background and foreground colors
- Implement proper ARIA labels
- Add descriptive alt text for images
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Implement skip navigation links

## STEP 5: Implement Security & Best Practices (Target: 100)
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implement HSTS policy
- Add X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options
- Set up proper security headers
- Add source maps for JavaScript debugging

## STEP 6: Final Optimization
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Set up automated CSS purging
- Optimize all images and assets
- Test all functionality works correctly

Please start by analyzing my current code and then implement ALL these optimizations step by step. Show me the exact code changes needed for each step. I want to achieve 100 on all metrics!

Make sure to:
1. Test that everything still works after each change
2. Show me before/after code comparisons
3. Explain what each optimization does
4. Give me testing instructions for each step
