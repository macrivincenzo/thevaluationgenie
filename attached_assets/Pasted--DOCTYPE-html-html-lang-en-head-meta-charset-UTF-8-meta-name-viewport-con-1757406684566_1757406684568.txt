                    <p>EcoFitness Gear was valued at <strong>$1,512,000</strong> using our SDE methodology. The owner initially thought their business was worth only $800,000 based on revenue multiples. Our calculator revealed an additional <strong>$712,000 in value</strong> by properly accounting for owner benefits, brand value, and using D2C-appropriate multiples.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How accurate is your e-commerce valuation calculator?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Our calculator uses the same SDE methodology trusted by business brokers and lenders nationwide. While no online calculator can replace a professional appraisal, our results are typically within 10-15% of professional valuations, making it an excellent starting point for planning and negotiations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: What's the difference between SDE and EBITDA for e-commerce valuation?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> SDE (Seller's Discretionary Earnings) is preferred for e-commerce businesses under $5M in revenue because it adds back owner benefits, making it more accurate for small business valuations. EBITDA is typically used for larger corporations and doesn't account for owner compensation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: How often should I get my e-commerce business valued?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> We recommend getting a valuation annually or whenever you're considering major decisions like selling, seeking investment, or bringing in partners. E-commerce markets evolve rapidly, and your business value can change significantly over time.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Can I use this calculator for marketplace-only businesses?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, but marketplace-only businesses have additional considerations like platform dependency, fee structures, and account suspension risks. Our calculator provides a base valuation, but platform-specific factors may require additional analysis.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: What if my e-commerce business is losing money?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Our calculator can still provide insights, but unprofitable e-commerce businesses are typically valued based on asset value, customer base, or intellectual property rather than earnings. We'll help you understand your options and potential turnaround strategies.</p>
